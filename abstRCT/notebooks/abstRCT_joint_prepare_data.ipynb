      " Single-agent therapy with bicalutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, was compared with castration, either surgical or medical, in patients with untreated Stage D2 prostate cancer. In an open, randomized, multicenter trial, patients were randomized to treatment with 50 mg bicalutamide (n = 243) once daily or to castration (n = 243), either orchiectomy or depot injection of goserelin acetate every 28 days. Primary efficacy endpoints were times to treatment failure and objective disease progression and survival. Assessments included review of measurable metastases, prostate dimensions, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, pain, analgesic requirements, and quality of life responses. The median duration of therapy was 39 weeks for bicalutamide-treated patients and 42 weeks for castrated patients; treatment failure occurred in 53% and 42% and disease progression in 43% and 33%, respectively.Treatment effects favored castration for both endpoints (P < or = 0.002), with hazard ratios (bicalutamide:castration) of 1.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18 to 2.00) for time to treatment failure and 1.6 (95% CI, 1.19 to 2.15) for time to disease progression.From the 1-year survival analysis, the hazard ratio for probability of death was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.72).Thus far, with a median follow-up of 86 weeks, median survival has not been reached in either group.Changes from baseline in several quality of life variables were significantly different (P < or = 0.01) between treatment groups periodically from months 1 to 6, and all favored bicalutamide.Overall, the antiandrogen was well tolerated compared with castration;with bicalutamide, hot flushes occurred less often and breast tenderness and gynecomastia more often.Although a dosage of 50 mg of bicalutamide once daily was not as effective as castration,the favorable quality of life outcomes and the low incidence of nonhormonal adverse events provide reasons to evaluate bicalutamide, as a single therapeutic agent, at higher doses.\n",

      " To investigate the effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on appetite, weight, and quality of life (QL) in patients with advanced-stage, incurable, non-hormone-sensitive cancer. Two hundred six eligible patients were randomized between double-blind MPA 500 mg twice daily or placebo. Appetite (0 to 10 numerical rating scale), weight, and QL (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC-QLQ-C30]) were assessed before the start of treatment (t = 0), and 6 weeks (t = 6) and 12 weeks (t = 12) thereafter. One hundred thirty-four patients (68 MPA and 66 placebo) were assessable at t = 6 and 99 patients (53 MPA and 46 placebo) at t = 12.A beneficial effect of MPA on appetite was observed after both 6 weeks (P = .008) and 12 weeks (P = .01) of treatment.After 12 weeks, a mean weight gain of 0.6 +/- 4.4 kg was seen in the MPA, versus an ongoing mean weight loss of 1.4 +/- 4.6 kg in the placebo group.This difference of 2.0 kg was statistically significant (P = .04).During the study, several areas of QL deteriorated in the total group of patients.With the exception of an improvement in appetite and possible also a reduction in nausea and vomiting, no measurable beneficial effects of MPA on QL could be demonstrated.The side effects profile of MPA was favorable: only a trend toward an increase in (usually mild) peripheral edema was observed.In weight-losing, advanced-stage non-hormone-sensitive cancer patients, MPA exhibits a mild side effects profile, has a beneficial effect on appetite, and may prevent further weight loss.However, general QL in the present study was not measurably influenced by MPA treatment.\n",

      "In a randomized clinical trial, the authors compared the use of postoperative subconjunctival injections of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in 19 eyes with a single intraoperative application of subconjunctival mitomycin (MMC) at the filtering site in 20 eyes at high risk for failure of glaucoma filtering surgery.Six months after surgery, intraocular pressures averaged 10.9 +/- 5.3 mmHg (mean +/- standard deviation) in the MMC-treated eyes versus 14.2 +/- 5.5 mmHg in the 5-FU-treated eyes (P = 0.08) and were less than or equal to 12 mmHg in 60.0% of MMC-treated eyes and 21.1% of 5-FU-treated eyes (P = 0.03).Mitomycin-treated eyes were receiving an average of 0.3 +/- 0.5 medications for intraocular pressure control, and 5-FU-treated eyes were receiving an average of 1.1 +/- 1.1 medications (P = 0.01).Drug-induced corneal epithelial defects were seen in nine 5-FU-treated eyes and in no MMC-treated eyes (P = 0.0004).These results suggest that intraoperative MMC may be a viable alternative to postoperative 5-FU, with lower overall intraocular pressures, decreased dependence on postoperative ocular antihypertensive medications, and decreased corneal toxicity.\n",

      " To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a slow-release formulation of cytarabine (DepoCyt; Chiron Corp, Emeryville, CA, and Skye Pharma, Inc, San Diego, CA) that maintains cytotoxic concentrations of cytarabine (ara-C) in the CSF of most patients for more than 14 days. Twenty-eight patients with lymphoma and a positive CSF cytology were randomized to receive DepoCyt 50 mg once every 2 weeks or free ara-C 50 mg twice a week for 1 month. Patients whose CSF cytology converted to negative and who did not have neurologic progression received an additional 3 months of consolidation therapy and then 4 months of maintenance therapy. All patients received dexamethasone 4 mg orally bid on days 1 through 5 of each 2-week cycle.The response rate was 71% for DepoCyt and 15% for ara-C on an intent-to-treat basis (P =.006).All of the patients on the DepoCyt arm but only 53% of those on the ara-C arm were able to complete the planned 1-month induction therapy regimen.Time to neurologic progression and survival trend in favor of DepoCyt (median, 78.5 v 42 days and 99.5 v 63 days, respectively; P >.05).DepoCyt treatment was associated with an improved mean change in Karnofsky performance score at the end of induction (P =.041).The major adverse events on both arms were headache and arachnoiditis, which were often caused by the underlying disease.DepoCyt injected once every 2 weeks produced a high response rate and a better quality of life as measured by Karnofsky score relative to that produced by free ara-C injected twice a week.\n",
