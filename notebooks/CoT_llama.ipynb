In this case, it\\'s \"we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance\".\\n\\n2. **Identifying the Premise**: The first step in argument mining is to identify the premise, which is the foundation of the argument. In this case, the premise is \"we have to be aware\".\\n\\n3. **Analyzing the Premise**: The premise \"we have to be aware\" can be further broken down into two parts:\\n   - **Subject**: \"we\" (referring to the speaker or the group)\\n   - **Object**: \"be aware\" (referring to the action or the state)\\n\\n4. **Identifying the Premise\\'s Role**: The phrase \"we have to be aware\" implies that there is a responsibility or a duty to be aware. This suggests that the argument is not just about being aware, but also about the responsibility or duty that comes with it.\\n\\n5. **Determining the Component Type**: Based on the analysis, the argument component can be classified as follows:\\n   - **Major Claim**: \"We have to be aware\" is the major claim, as it presents the central idea or position of the argument.\\n   - **Claim**: \"We have to be aware\" is the claim, as it is the statement that the speaker or the group is making.\\n   - **Premise**: The premise \"we have to be aware\" is the premise, as it provides the foundation or the starting point for the argument.\\n\\n### Final Classification\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the final classification of the argument component is:\\n\\n{\"component_type\": [\"MajorClaim\"]}',\n",

It implies a high degree of confidence or certainty.\\n\\n2. **\"spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future\"**: This statement is a claim, as it makes a specific assertion about the future. The claim is that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in the near future.\\n\\n3. **\"Main Trend\"**: This phrase is a premise, as it sets the stage for the rest of the argument. It implies that the trend in question is significant and will have a major impact.\\n\\n4. **\"near future\"**: This phrase is a temporal reference, indicating when the trend is expected to occur.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s classify this argument component:\\n\\n- **\"MajorClaim\"**: This is the most general and specific type of claim. In this case, the claim is that \"spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future\". This is a major claim because it is specific, general, and makes a significant assertion about the future.\\n\\n- **\"Claim\"**: This is a more specific type of claim. In this case, the claim is that \"spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future\". This is a claim because it is a specific assertion about the future.\\n\\n- **\"Premise\"**: This is not applicable here, as the argument component is a claim, not a premise.\\n\\nTherefore, the classification of the argument component is:\\n\\n- **\"MajorClaim\"**: The claim is that \"spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future\".\\n\\nHere is the classification in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\"component_type\": [\"MajorClaim\"]}\\n```',\n",

In this case, the premise is \"In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.\"\\n\\n2. **Determine the Claim**: The next step is to determine if the premise is a claim or not. A claim is a specific statement that can be either true or false. In this case, the premise is a statement about the benefits of having more qualified teachers and better access to technology in big cities.\\n\\n3. **Identify the Major Claim**: The major claim is the central idea or argument that the author is trying to make. In this case, the major claim is \"In a big city, having more qualified teachers and better access to technology is beneficial.\"\\n\\n4. **Check for Inductive Reasoning**: The author is making a general statement about the benefits of having more qualified teachers and better access to technology in big cities. This suggests that the argument is based on inductive reasoning, where the author is making a general conclusion based on specific observations.\\n\\n5. **Check for Logical Fallacy**: The author is making a causal link between having more qualified teachers and having better access to technology. However, it\\'s not clear if this is a necessary condition or a sufficient condition. For example, having better access to technology is not a necessary condition for having more qualified teachers.\\n\\n6. **Check for Counterexamples**: There are no clear counterexamples to the argument, suggesting that it is not universally true.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, I classify the argument component as:\\n\\n**\"MajorClaim\"**\\n\\nThe major claim is \"In a big city, having more qualified teachers and better access to technology is beneficial.\"',\n",

It is a logical connection that shows how the premise leads to the conclusion.\\n\\n5. **Classification**: Based on the analysis, the argument component can be classified as follows:\\n\\n- **Major Claim**: The argument is making a claim about the economic contribution of tourism to the Czech Republic. Therefore, the Major Claim is \"Tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic\\'s economy.\"\\n\\n- **Claim**: The argument is stating a fact about the economic contribution of tourism. Therefore, the Claim is \"Tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic\\'s economy.\"\\n\\n- **Premise**: The argument is stating the foundation of the argument, which is the economic contribution of tourism to the Czech Republic.

In this case, the premise is \"we have to be aware\".\\n\\n3. **Analyzing the Premise**: The premise \"we have to be aware\" can be further broken down into two parts:\\n   - **Subject**: \"we\" (referring to the speaker or the group)\\n   - **Object**: \"be aware\" (referring to the action or the state)\\n\\n4. **Identifying the Premise\\'s Role**: The phrase \"we have to be aware\" implies that there is a responsibility or a duty to be aware. This suggests that the argument is not just about being aware, but also about the responsibility or duty that comes with it.\\n\\n5. **Determining the Component Type**: Based on the analysis, the argument component can be classified as follows:\\n   - **Major Claim**: \"We have to be aware\" is the major claim, as it presents the central idea or position of the argument.\\n   - **Claim**: \"We have to be aware\" is the claim, as it is the statement that the speaker or the group is making.\\n   - **Premise**: The premise \"we have to be aware\" is the premise, as it provides the foundation or the starting point for the argument.\\n\\n### Final Classification\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the final classification of the argument component is:\\n\\n{\"component_type\": [\"MajorClaim\"]}',\n",

The claim is that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in the near future.\\n\\n3. **\"Main Trend\"**: This phrase is a premise, as it sets the stage for the rest of the argument.

A claim is a specific statement that can be either true or false. In this case, the premise is a statement about the benefits of having more qualified teachers and better access to technology in big cities.\\n\\n3. **Identify the Major Claim**: The major claim is the central idea or argument that the author is trying to make. In this case, the major claim is \"In a big city, having more qualified teachers and better access to technology is beneficial.\"\\n\\n4. **Check for Inductive Reasoning**: The author is making a general statement about the benefits of having more qualified teachers and better access to technology in big cities. This suggests that the argument is based on inductive reasoning, where the author is making a general conclusion based on specific observations.\\n\\n5. **Check for Logical Fallacy**: The author is making a causal link between having more qualified teachers and having better access to technology. However, it\\'s not clear if this is a necessary condition or a sufficient condition.
