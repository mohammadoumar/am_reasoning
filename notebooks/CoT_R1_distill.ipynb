It\\'s pointing out a negative impact of technology on language, specifically how social media platforms are contributing to this issue. So, it\\'s about the effect of these platforms on language use.\\n\\nNext, syntactic structure.

It\\'s not just a general statement; it\\'s tied to the examples given.\\n\\nLooking at the context, the essay\\'s thesis is that technology designed to simplify life often complicates it. The component is providing evidence that technology, specifically social media, is making language worse, which supports the thesis by showing a negative side effect.\\n\\nFunction-wise, this component is providing a specific example of how technology affects language, which is a premise because it\\'s the evidence supporting the main claim that technology complicates life. It\\'s not the central claim itself but the evidence that supports it.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, this component is a Premise because it\\'s the evidence that supports the MajorClaim that technology complicates life.\\n</think>\\n\\n{\"component_type\": [\"Premise\"]}',\n",
