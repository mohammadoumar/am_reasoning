       "['Chapter 2. Argument Components\\n2.2. Annotation of Major Claims\\nIn example 2.2.5 the major claim covers several statements. Since there is no in-\\nference included in this sentence, all the statements except the shell phrase at the\\nbeginning are annotated as one single major claim.\\nExample 2.2.6 (Introduction): The idea of school uniforms seems like\\nan antiquated concept for many people. Unless a child attends private\\nschool, it is not normally practiced by children and families. Students\\nstudying in schools requiring school uniforms generally perform very well\\nacademically and seem happy wearing the same outﬁt every day. [There\\nare many beneﬁts to wearing school uniforms that schools all\\naround the world should incorporate into their public schools].\\nExample 2.2.6 does not include any indicator like opinion expressions. In this case\\nit is more complicated to identify the major claim. However, from the context ist\\nshould be clear that the previous sentence are some reasons supporting the stance\\nof the author, namely the last sentence which is the major claim.\\nExample 2.2.7 (Introduction): “As the way to cloning has been found,\\nthere has been a debate about if it is right or wrong to clone a hu-\\nman. Some people think that cloning is beneﬁcial for humankind while\\nother people argue that [cloning has too many disadvantages]. I\\nagree with the latter view and will give several reasons in the following\\nparagraphs.”\\nIn example 2.2.7 the last sentence includes a stance expression which might signal\\nthe presence of a major claim. However, since this sentence does not include any\\ncontent relevant information, the referenced statement should be annotated.\\nExample 2.2.8 (Introduction): “And ﬁnally medicine with the help of\\ntechnology has developed its most extreme product, the human being!\\nSome say that it is a big step towards immortality. However, I strongly\\ndisagree with this view because of the following reasons.”\\nThe introduction in 2.2.8 illustrates a complicated example. The author disagrees\\nwith a given statement. Just annotating the statement would be wrong because the\\nauthor’s stance is actually the opposite. The last sentence includes nothing con-\\ntent relevant. Therefore, we are not able to annotate a major claim. If the last to\\nsentence would be incorporated in one single sentence we could annotate the whole\\nsentence. However, these annotation guidelines does not allow to annotate several\\nsentence as an argument component. So, we should search the major claim in the\\nconclusion and if it is also not present, we will not annotate a major claim.\\nNote that in some essays the introduction or conclusion also includes reasons which\\nsupport the major claim. In these cases it might be complicated to distinguish be-\\ntween major claims and the supporting statements which should be annotated as\\nclaims (cp. section 2.3). Example 2.2.9 illustrates such a case:\\n11\\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2. Argument Components\\n2.3. Annotation of Claims\\nExample 2.2.9 (Introduction): “... . I believe that [we should invest\\nin cloning technology]. Cloning helps to develop new cures for lethal\\ndiseases. Cloning of animals and organs can be beneﬁcial for humankind.\\nIt could also foster research in biomedicine which would be an important\\nstep towards new technologies.”\\nIn this example only the ﬁrst sentence contains the major claim, since it represents\\nthe stance of the author towards the topic (in this case “Cloning”). The second,\\nthird and fourth sentences provide several reasons to support the author’s stance.\\nTherefore these sentences (2-4) do not include major claims but reasons which should\\nbe annotated as claims.\\n2.3\\nAnnotation of Claims\\nA claim is a direct support (or refutation) of the author’s stance. So, it is a direct\\nreason given in support (or attack in the case of a contra argument) of the major\\nclaim. In body paragraphs2, a claim is usually supported with one or several rea-\\nsons/premises whereas in the introduction or conclusion, a claim appears as a direct\\nreason of the major claim. Commonly, the claim is an assumption that should not\\nbe accepted without additional support. Since the characteristic of claims in body\\nparagraphs might diﬀer from claims in introductions or conclusions, we distinguish\\nthese two cases in our guideline. However, in both cases, each claim has a stance\\nattribute which denotes if the claim is “for” or “against” the major claim. We will\\nillustrate this attribute in the examples given in the following sections.\\n2.3.1\\nClaims in Body Paragraphs\\nA claim in an body paragraph is the central component of an argument. It appears\\nfrequently as an initial assumption located at the beginning of a paragraph or as a\\nconclusion near the end. In few cases, the claim might also be located somewhere\\nbetween the statements of a paragraph. Most frequently, one paragraph includes\\na single unique claim and there are only few cases where several claims/arguments\\nare included in a single body paragraph. In this case, a paragraph includes several\\narguments covering diﬀerent topics or aspects related to the topic.\\nCommonly, a claim does not appear without reasons (premises) in an body para-\\ngraph. So, for annotating claims in body paragraphs, it might help to identify which\\nstatements are reasons for others. If there is one statement which is not a reason for\\nanother statement in the paragraph, it is likely the claim of an argument. During\\nthe annotation process it might also help to be aware of the major claim, since the\\nclaims are direct reasons for the stance of the author. So, it is likely that claims in\\nbody paragraphs share some entities with the major claim (e.g. locations, persons\\nor general noun phrases).\\nFor getting familiar with the annotation of claims in body paragraphs, we will\\ninvestigate some examples. In each example, the major claim of the essay is included\\n2paragraphs between introductions and conclusion\\n12\\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2. Argument Components\\n2.3. Annotation of Claims\\nsince it might help to identify the claims in body paragraphs. In each example the\\nclaim/s of the paragraph is/are in square brackets and underlined.\\nExample 2.3.1.1:\\nMajor Claim: “Cloning is an important technology for humankind”\\nParagraph: “[The technology of cloning can be helpful for developing\\nnew cures]. For example, by reproducing organs like kidneys or levers,\\nmany people with serious diseases can be healed. In addition, it might\\nbe helpful for understanding other important processes in the area of\\ngene technology which can help to invent new kinds of treatments.”\\nIn this example, the claim is given as the ﬁrst statement in the paragraph. It is\\nan initial assumption and a direct support of the major claim. The two following\\nsentences are reasons given for the claim. These reasons are the premises which\\nsupport the claim. Since the ﬁrst statement does not serve as a reason for another\\nstatement (there are no outgoing support relations, cp. section 3), it is likely to be\\nthe claim. Also note that the rules for argument component boundaries hold for\\nclaims. The stance attribute of the claim in this example should be set to “for”\\nsince it supports the major claim.\\nExample 2.3.1.2:\\nMajor Claim: “It is dangerous to clone humans”\\nParagraph: “The consequences of cloning humans are incalculable since\\nno scientist has ever cloned a human being. It might cause terrible conse-\\nquences and uncontrollable changes in the human gene pool. Therefore,\\n[human cloning should be prohibited].”\\nIn this example, there are two candidates which could serve as a premise. The ﬁrst\\npart of the ﬁrst sentence seems to be a direct support for the major claim. However,\\nthis statement is a support for the last sentence, so it cannot be the claim of this\\nparagraph. The last sentence however starts with the indicator “therefore” which\\nis a strong signal for the presence of a claim. In addition, the ﬁrst statement is a\\nreason given why human cloning should be prohibited. The second sentence also\\nseems to be a good reason for this statement. So the last sentence does not serve as\\na reason for another statement in this paragraph; it seems to be the conclusion of\\nall the reasons given and therefore it should be annotated as the claim. The stance\\nof this claim is again “for” because it supports the major claim.\\nExample 2.3.1.3:\\nMajor Claim: “Some museums will not disappear”\\nParagraph: “Admittedly, [it is more convenient to learn about historical\\nor art items online]. With Internet, people do not need to travel long\\ndistances to have a real look at a painting or a sculpture, which probably\\ntakes a lot of time and travel fees.”\\nThe third example includes a contra argument against the major claim. So the\\nstance of the claim in the ﬁrst sentence is set to “against”. The second statement\\nsupports this contra claim; therefore, it is a premise given and the ﬁrst statement is\\nthe claim of this argument.\\n13\\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2. Argument Components\\n2.3. Annotation of Claims\\nExample 2.3.1.4:\\nMajor Claim: “Technology negatively inﬂuences the way how people\\ncommunicate”\\nParagraph: “[Some people use their cellphone everywhere and do not\\neven notice their environment]. Furthermore, [the language changed due\\nto this new technology].”\\nExample 2.3.1.4 is a very infrequent case.\\nThere are two reasons given for the\\nmajor claim. The ﬁrst is about the overuse of cell phones and the second about the\\ninﬂuence of technology on language. These two topics are not related and neither\\ndoes the ﬁrst statement support the second nor the second the ﬁrst. However, since\\nboth are reasons for the major claim, the two statements are annotated as claims.\\nThe stance attribute of both claims should be set to “for” since both support the\\nmajor claim. Note again that this case, occurs relatively infrequently in persuasive\\nessays.\\nExample 2.3.1.5:\\nMajor Claim: “School uniforms should be mandatory in each school.”\\nParagraph: “First, by wearing the same clothes, students learn to judge\\npeople without looking at their appearance and expensive brands of\\nclothing.\\n[School uniforms will decrease bullying which is very com-\\nmon in todays’ schools]. If someone looks richer, most people feel like\\nthey have a higher social status or more power.”\\nIn this example the claim is located in the middle of the paragraph. It is a direct\\nreason given for the major claim and the ﬁrst and last sentence include some reasons\\nwhich support the claim. Also note, that in this example no indicators are present.\\nFor identifying the claim in this case, it is necessary to recognize how the statements\\nsupport each other. The stance is again “for”.\\nExample 2.3.1.6:\\nMajor Claim: “Cloning is a new technology that is necessary for our\\nworld”\\nParagraph: “First, [cloning organs is useful for the treatment of lethal\\ndiseases]. Thanks to organ transplantation by cloning, people may be\\nhealthier and happier. Furthermore, [cloning animals enables develop-\\nments in science] because more animals can be used for experiments.\\nThis is the useful side of cloning.”\\nThis example includes two diﬀerent arguments. This is denoted by two diﬀerent\\naspects of the topic. The ﬁrst argument is about healing diseases by using cloning\\nand the second aspect is about novel (more general) developments in science. So\\nthis example includes two diﬀerent arguments which both support the major claim.\\nTherefore, the stance attribute of each claim is “for”.\\nExample 2.3.1.7:\\nMajor Claim: “Cloning is a threat for our society.”\\n14\\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2. Argument Components\\n2.3. Annotation of Claims\\nParagraph: “By cloning humans there would be a split in the society.\\nClones would have extraordinary abilities which are a result of improving\\ntheir human genes. For instance, genes could be manipulated in such\\na way that this novel human generation is immune against common\\ndiseases. Consequently, [it would be difﬁcult for clones to integrate well\\nin today’s society].”\\nIn this example, the ﬁrst and the last sentence seem to be good candidates for the\\nclaim. Both are similar, the given reasons support both statements and both seem\\nto be good reasons for the major claim. However, on closer inspection the state-\\nment in the ﬁrst sentence emerges as a reason for the last statement. In addition,\\nthe last statement includes the indicator “consequently” which is a strong indicator\\nfor a conclusion. Therefore, the last statement should be annotated as a claim. It’s\\nstance is “for” since it supports the major claim.\\nExample 2.3.1.2 and example 2.3.1.7 showed that indicators like discourse connec-\\ntives can facilitate the identiﬁcation of claims. Appendix A includes a list of claim\\nindicators which frequently signal the presence of claims. However, these indicators\\nare not a warrantor for the presence of a claim. There are some cases in which such\\nan indicator is used for a preliminary ‘result’ e.g. in a reasoning chain. So, even\\nif one or several of these indicators is/are present in a paragraph, it is necessary\\nto understand the content and to recognize which statements support (or attack)\\neach other. As mentioned above, the major claim should be also considered when\\nsearching for a claim in paragraph.\\n2.3.2\\nClaims in Introductions and Conclusions\\nIn the introduction or conclusion, a claim appears as a direct reason (or refutation) of\\nthe major claim. In many cases, the claims are located adjacent to the major claim.\\nIn contrast to body paragraphs, the introduction or conclusion infrequently includes\\ncomplete arguments including premises and often the claims are reformulations of\\nthe arguments included in body paragraphs (for instance it is likely that a conclusion\\ncontains a condensed version of the key claims given previously). The following\\nexamples illustrate claims in introductions and conclusions. In these examples the\\nmajor claim is in bold face (if present) and the claims are underlined. Both are also\\nput in square brackets to illustrate the boundaries more precisely.\\nExample 2.3.2.1 (Introduction): “Do you want a twin that is cloned\\nfrom you? Do you think it is necessary? Or do you think it is unethical\\nand should be banned? I strongly believe that [cloning is a new tech-\\nnology that is necessary for our world]. I have various reasons for\\nthis: [it is necessary for the treatment of some illnesses such as leukemia\\nand it provides our children better lives].”\\nThis example starts with three rhetorical questions which introduce and clarify the\\ndebatable character of the topic. The following sentence includes a very precise\\nstandpoint of the author followed by reasons given as support for it. These reasons\\n15\\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2. Argument Components\\n2.3. Annotation of Claims\\ndirectly support the major claim. Therefore, they are annotated as claims with\\nthe stance attribute set to “for”. Since the last sentence includes an enumeration\\nof several direct reasons for the major claim it is not split into several argument\\ncomponents.\\nExample 2.3.2.2 (Conclusion): “To sum up, although [cloning humans\\nmight bear some risks], I strongly believe that [this technology is\\nbeneﬁcial for humanity]. [It is likely that this technology bears some\\nimportant cures which will significantly improve the life conditions].”\\nThis example of a conclusion includes two claims surrounding the major claim. The\\nﬁrst claim is a rebuttal which illustrates some risks of cloning. It is a statement\\nwhich directly attacks the major claim or the author’s stance respectively, so the\\nstance attribute for this claim should be set to “against”. The last sentence includes\\na reason which supports the major claim. Therefore, it is annotated as a claim and\\nthe stance attribute of it is set to “for”.\\nExample 2.3.2.3 (Introduction): “As the way to cloning has been\\nfound, there has been an argument about if it is right or wrong to clone\\na human.\\nSome people argue for and others against cloning, but we\\ncannot reach an agreement because there is no evidence supporting ei-\\nther side. However, as far as I am concerned, [the disadvantages of\\ncloning outweigh the advantages] because [the consequence of these\\nexperiments are not foreseeable].”\\nThe third example illustrates an introduction where the last sentence includes the\\nmajor claim. In the same sentence there is a reason given which supports the major\\nclaim. Since the reason can be separated as a statement (cp. rules for argumentation\\nboundaries in section 2.1), it is annotate as a claim. Its stance attribute is set to\\n“for”.\\nExample 2.3.2.4 (Introduction): “And ﬁnally medicine with the help of\\ntechnology has developed its most extreme product, the human being!\\nSome say that it is a big step towards immortality, while some claim\\nthat it is something unnatural. Since [it us unnatural and unethical], [I\\ndeﬁnitely disagree with the idea of human cloning].”\\nIn this example, there a reason precedes the major claim. Since, it can be sepa-\\nrated using the guideline for argument component boundaries, it is annotated as a\\nsupporting claim for the major claim. It’s stance attribute is set to “for”.\\nExample 2.3.2.5 (Conclusion): “To conclude, although [school uni-\\nforms are expensive], I think [they should me mandatory in each\\nschool].\\n[They will prevent bullying] because by wearing the same\\nclothes pupils do not judge their classmates by their appearance and\\nbrand-name cloths.”\\n16\\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2. Argument Components\\n2.4. Annotation of Premises\\nThe last example illustrates an argument following the major claim in a conclusion.\\nThe last sentences includes two statements. The ﬁrst statement is a direct reason\\ngiven for the major claim. Therefore, it is annotated as a claim (stance attribute\\nis “for”) followed by a premise in the same sentence. In addition, a contra claim\\nprecedes the major claim. It is a contra reason and therefore its stance attribute is\\nset to “against”.\\n2.4\\nAnnotation of Premises\\nIn this step, we focus on the annotation of the second argument component: the\\npremise.\\nA premise is a reason given for supporting or attacking an argument\\ncomponent. So it can be considered as a justiﬁcation or refutation for convincing\\nthe reader of the truth or falsity of a claim. This also means that a premise is always\\nconnected to another argument component which could either be a claim or another\\npremise if there are reasoning chains included in a paragraph. Note that in contrast\\nto the claim annotation, the stance of each premise is not encoded in an attribute. It\\nwill be annotated by support or attack relations which link the premises to claims or\\nother premises. For example the statement “Children bring happiness and meaning\\nto your life” is a supporting premise whereas “It is a heavy psychological burden to\\nhave children” is an attacking premise for the claim “Having children is the ultimate\\nbliss in our lives”. In this case both should be annotated as premises, the distinction\\nbetween supporting and attacking premises by means of argumentative relations is\\ndescribed in chapter 3.\\nSince the context and the identiﬁed claims from the previous step are important\\nfor annotating premises, the annotator should search for each claim in a paragraph\\nand ﬁnd the reasons given for it.\\nIt is possible that a claim and a premise are\\nincluded in a single sentence or that a premise is only a part of a sentence. So\\nthe annotation of premises is also conducted at the clause level and the rules for\\nargument components should be followed.\\nUsually, there are several premises given for a single claim in a paragraph. Some-\\ntimes there are also reasoning chains where several premises are linked together for\\nsupporting a claim. The following examples illustrate the annotation of premises in\\ndetail (the premises are wavy underlined).\\nExample 2.4.1 (Body paragraph): “First, [cloning can help human\\nfamilies to gain children]. For instance, [ :::::::\\nparents:::::\\nwith::::\\nno :::::\\neggs:::\\nor ::::::::\\nsperms\\n::::\\ncan ::::::\\ncreate:::::::::\\nchildren:::::\\nthat::::\\nare::::::::::::\\ngenetically ::::::::\\nrelated]. [ :::::\\nEven :::::\\nsame::::\\nsex:::::::::\\ncouples\\n::::\\ncan :::::\\nhave:::::::::\\nchildren:::::::::\\nwithout ::::\\nthe ::::\\nuse ::of:::::::\\ndonor:::::::\\nsperm:::\\nor:::::::\\ndonor :::::\\neggs].”\\nIn this example, the ﬁrst statement is a claim which is supported by two premises.\\nBoth of the premises are indented to convince the reader that cloning is a positive\\ndevelopment and that there are particular families which will beneﬁt from this tech-\\nnology. Note that this example includes two argumentative relations connecting the\\ntwo premises to the claim. Both of these relations indicate that the source argu-\\nment components (the two premises) are reasons given for the target component\\n(the claim). Having this structure in mind also helps to identify the claim. As men-\\ntioned in the introduction of this guideline, the argumentation structure is always\\n17\\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2. Argument Components\\n2.4. Annotation of Premises\\na tree and the root node of a tree is always a claim. So, for annotating argument\\ncomponents, it is helpful to imaging the argumentation structure and to recognize\\nwhich statement supports or attacks another one and vice versa. In this example, it\\nis only possible to connect the argument component two and three to the ﬁrst one.\\nSo the ﬁrst component, which is the root of the argumentation structure is likely to\\nbe the claim of the paragraph.\\nExample 2.4.2 (Body paragraph): “[::::::\\nThere:::::::\\nwould:::\\nbe::a ::::\\nlack:::\\nof :::::::::::\\nuniqueness\\n::::\\nand :::::::\\nviolate::::::::::::\\nconvictions:::::::::::\\nregarding :::::::\\nhuman::::::::::::::\\nindividuality::::\\nand:::::::::\\nfreedom]. So,\\n[ ::::::\\nclones ::::::\\ncould::::\\nbe:::::\\nseen:::as:::::\\nless::::::\\nthan ::::::::\\nhuman:::::::::::\\ncompared::::::\\nwith :::::::::::\\nnon-clones].\\nTherefore, [human cloning would divide our society into two different\\ngroups].”\\nThis example illustrates a reasoning chain including one claim at the end of the\\nparagraph and two preceding premises. The ﬁrst premise is a reason given for the\\nsecond premises which is a reason given for the claim. The chain of reasoning is\\nindicated by indicators. Both indicators, “so” and “therefore”, signal a conclusion\\nbased on preceding statement(s). However, since all statements form a chain, only\\nthe last statement (or the root of the tree) is annotated as a claim.\\nExample 2.4.3 (Body paragraph): “[Having children is the ultimate\\nbliss in our lives]. There are many reasons which support my viewpoint.\\nFor example, [::a :::::\\nclose:::::::\\nfriend ::of::::::\\nmine ::is:::\\nso :::::::\\nhappy :::::\\nsince::::\\nher::::::\\nchild ::::\\nwas:::::\\nborn].\\n[ :::\\nShe:::::\\nsays:::::\\nthat:::::::\\nraising::a::::::\\nchild ::is::::\\nlike:::::::\\nhaving:::\\nan:::::::::::\\nimportant:::::\\ngoal:::\\nin :::\\nlife] since\\n[ ::::::::\\nbringing::::\\nup :a::::::::\\nhuman:::::::\\nbeing ::is::::::\\nmore::::::::::::\\nsatisfactory::::::\\nthan::::::::::\\nanything ::::\\nelse].”\\nThis example illustrates a paragraph where a sentence does not include argumenta-\\ntive content. The second sentence only states that there are reasons without stating\\nthem. So, it is not annotated as a premise. The third sentence includes an example\\nreferring to a close friend. It is some kind of evidence indented to support the claim\\nin the ﬁrst sentence. Therefore, it is annotated as premise. The fourth sentence\\nincludes two premises which are connected by means of the discourse connective\\n“since”. Both are annotated as premises because the sentence includes an inference\\n(cp. section 2.1).\\nExample 2.4.4 (Conclusion): “To conclude, although [having children\\ncould be considered as a ﬁnancial burden], I think that [it is the ulti-\\nmate goal]. [Nobody will regret to have children] since [:::::::\\nhaving :::::::::\\nchildren\\n::::::\\nbrings:::::::::::\\nhappiness:::::\\nand :::::::::\\nmeaning:::\\nto::::\\nour:::::\\nlives].”\\nExample 2.4.4 illustrates a conclusion including a premise.\\nGenerally, this case\\nis quite infrequent. The conclusion begins with a claim against the major claim\\nfollowed by another claim supporting the major claim in the last sentence. Since\\nthe last sentence includes two statements and the second statement supports the\\npreceding one, the second statement is annotated as a premise for the preceding\\nclaim. Note again, that direct reasons given for the major claim should be annotated\\nas claims and not as premises. Only if there are additional reasons given for a claim\\nin a conclusion, like in example 2.4.4, they should be annotated as a premise.\\n18\\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2. Argument Components\\n2.4. Annotation of Premises\\nExample 2.4.5\\nMajorClaim: “Cloning is an important technology for humankind”\\nBody paragraph: “Some people believe that [human cloning would di-\\nvide our society into two groups]. They argue that [:::::::\\nclones ::::\\nwill:::\\nbe::::::\\nseen\\n::\\nas:::::\\nless :::::::::::\\ncompared :::\\nto::::::::::\\nnaturally::::::\\nborn:::::::::\\nhumans] because [ ::::::\\nclones ::::\\nwill::::::\\nlack\\n:::::::::::\\nuniqueness:::::\\nand ::::::::::::::\\nindividuality].

The paragraph\\nstarts with a contra-claim stating that human cloning has some negative eﬀects on\\nour society.\\nThis claim is followed by a reasoning chain of supporting premises\\nin the second sentence. The third sentence is an attacking premise of the claim\\nwhich is supported by the last statement in the last sentence. Note again that the\\ndetermination between supporting and attacking premises is conducted by means of\\nargumentative relations. In this example the premise “a human clone will not diﬀer\\nthat much from other humans” will be linked with an attack relation to the claim.\\nThe author also adds an additional support to this premise in the last sentence\\nwhich will be linked using a support relation.\\nExample 2.4.6 (Body paragraph): “If human cloning became possible\\nwhat would be the outcome of it?\\nBasically I think [human cloning\\nis against the laws of nature].\\n[ ::::::\\nThere ::is:::a :::::\\nwell:::::::::::\\norganized :::::::::\\nbalance :::\\nof\\n:::::::\\nnature :::::\\nand ::::::::\\nhuman ::::::::\\ncloning:::::\\nmay:::::::::\\ndamage:::::\\nthis:::::::::::\\nwonderful:::::::::\\nbalance] since\\n[ :::\\nthe::::::::\\nnumber:::of::::::::\\npeople ::::::\\nwould:::::::::\\nincrease:::::\\ndue :::\\nto ::::::::\\ncloning].”\\nExample 2.4.6 begins with a rhetorical question.\\nGenerally, questions are non-\\nargumentative since the answer to the question is not known. So it is not annotated\\nas an argument component. The second sentence includes the claim of this para-\\ngraph. It is supported by the ﬁrst statement in sentence 3. Since the last sentence\\nincludes an inference and two statements, both are annotated as a premise.\\nAs for claims, premises are sometimes signaled by indicators which facilitate the\\nrecognition.\\nFor instance, indicators like “because”, “the reason for this is”, “in\\naddition” may signal the presence of a premise. A list of indicators for premises is\\nprovided in appendix B. Note again, that these indicators are not a guarantor for\\nthe presence of premises. It is necessary to understand the complete argumentation\\nstructure and to recognize which component supports or attack another one. For\\ninstance there might be cases where in a reasoning chain a claim indicator is used\\nby the author for emphasizing an “intermediate result”. Such an example is shown\\nin 2.4.2. The indicator “So” at the beginning of the second sentence might indicate\\na claim. However, since the argument component following this indicator is only an\\nintermediate result in a reasoning chain this statement is not annotated as the claim\\nof this paragraph.\\nA particular characteristics of indicators is that they signal the direction of rea-\\nsoning. For instance, indicators like “because”, “since”, “in addition”, “for example”\\n19\\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2. Argument Components\\n2.4. Annotation of Premises\\nor “ﬁrst”3 signal that the following statement refers to a preceding statement whereas\\nindicators like “therefore”, “as a result”, “hence” or “thus” signal that the following\\nstatement is a “result” of preceding statements. So, if an indicator is present in a\\nparagraph which signals that the following argument component i is a “result” of\\npreceding statements, the statement i is a good claim candidate. The same holds\\nfor indicators which signal that a statement refers to a preceding component. In this\\ncase the signaled component is likely to be a premise and not a claim. Recognizing\\nthe direction of the reasoning in a paragraph by means of indicators will strongly\\nfacilitate the annotation of argument components. So, before annotating any argu-\\nment component in a paragraph, it might help recognize the direction of reasoning\\nby means of the indicators (e.g. discourse connectives or shell language).\\n3Indicators which signal enumerations like “ﬁrst”, “second”, “in addition”, “furthermore”, etc.\\nindeed indicate that the following statement refers to a preceding one. However, frequently these\\nindicators are also used to enumerate the arguments in an essay and therefore the claims. In this\\ncase, a paragraph might start which an enumeration indicator followed by a direct reason for the\\nmajor claim which is frequently the claim of a paragraph. If enumeration indicators are present\\ninside of an paragraph it is likely that they enumerate the premises for a claim.\\n20\\n']"
